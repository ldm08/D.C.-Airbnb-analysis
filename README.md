## Installation
This repo uses the following libraries that do not come with the Anaconda distrbution of Python:
- plotly-express 0.4.1
- nltk 3.4.5
- seaborn 0.10.0

## Project Motivation 
For this project, I was interested in using the Washington D.C. Airbnb data to better understand:
### Properties & Pricing:
1. How does pricing look across neighborhoods? Can I still find a relatively cheaper priced listing in one of the more expensive neighborhoods?
2. How expensive are the top 25% of listings?
3. Does proximity to attractions play a factor in price?
4. Are there common property types, room types, bedroom and bathroom counts?
### Hosts:
5. Do hosts with multiple listings tend to be in certain neighborhoods?
6. Do hosts with multiple listings stick to certain price points?
7. Can we expect better reviews from hosts with businesses?
### Reviews:
8. Does sentiment in reviews tell us which neighborhoods or price ranges are better?
